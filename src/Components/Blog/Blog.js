                    <p>Pharmacists are required to deliver and receive feedback in a variety of formal and informal contexts. This may be as part of an appraisal or assessment; a particular aspect of work, such as punctuality, behaviour towards colleagues or patients; or on a presentation or manuscript. Pharmacists may also be required to deliver feedback to other healthcare professionals â€” for example, if a doctor has prescribed something inappropriately[5], is not acting on medication-related jobs, or repeatedly sends discharges late to the pharmacy..</p>
